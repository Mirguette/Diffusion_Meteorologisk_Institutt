# Diffusion_Meteorologisk_Institutt

This is the repository for my internship at the Norwegian Meterological Institute. 
The goal is to probe diffusion models to create synthetic high resolution AMSR-like brightness temperature fields for arctic sea ice, drawing on low resolution SSMI microwave retrievals.

The weights of the models can be found under apache licence at https://huggingface.co/Mirguette
